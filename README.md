# QUICK Container Benchmarks
Scripts and results from benchmarking containerized [QUICK](https://github.com/merzlab/QUICK).

The goal of this repo is to compare containerized QUICK to a local installation of QUICK on various hardware.

## Kubernetes
I used the National Research Platform (NRP) Nautilus, a distributed Kubernetes cluster.

Nautilus has a wide range of CPU and GPU hardware, making it an excellent test-bed.

## HPC
Using typical HPC resources like supercomputers scheduling jobs with Slurm.
